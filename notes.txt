1. async vs defer 

-> They are used as attritube inside script tag.

-> Both async and defer have one common thing: downloading of such scripts doesnâ€™t block page rendering.
 So the user can read page content and get acquainted with the page immediately.

html parsing =  ------


1. script 

  ------------                    -------------
              fetching  execution 



2. async

-> html parsing and script fetching is done parallely and during execution time html parsing is halt

  ------------------           --------------------
        fetching     execution 

-> order of execution is not maintain by async

-> It is used to load independent scripts like counters or ads

-> which loads first run first 

3. defer

-> html parsing and script fetching is done parallely but execution is done once parsing is completed

  ---------------------------------- 
            fetching                  execution


-> Used when relative order of execution is important
-> It is used to load dependent script



--------------------Session 2-----------------------------
PRODUCTION READYINESS - We need to buldling , minification , Compatibllity , 


1. package-lock.json - it will tell us what version production env is using
                     - lock the version keep the snapshots
                     - never keep it in git-ignore XD

        - integrity -> 
        - resolved  -> 

2. parcel -  npx parcel entry point   -  npx - execute using npm

             npx parcel index.html

 
  - HMR - Hot module Reload
      -File watcher algorithm (written in c++)
  - Bundler - bundle all the helpful code and give to us
  - Minification - .parcel-cache/dist
  - Cleaning our code
  - Super fast build algorithm
  - Image optimization - Images are heavy thing to load - parcel take care for that
  - Caching while development
  - Compression , Optimization - rename our code 
  - Compatible to older version of browser
  - HTTPS on development
  - PORT NUMBER
  - Consistent Hashing Algorithm - for caching
  - ZERO Config

  * .parcel-cache need to add in .git-ignore ( anything which can be generated in server will be push to git-ignore)

packages are minister XD , parcel is Amit shah , react - Narendra Modi

Transitive dependency - one package has its own dependency and those package will have their dependency
