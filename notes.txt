1. async vs defer 

-> They are used as attritube inside script tag.

-> Both async and defer have one common thing: downloading of such scripts doesnâ€™t block page rendering.
 So the user can read page content and get acquainted with the page immediately.

html parsing =  ------


1. script 

  ------------                    -------------
              fetching  execution 



2. async

-> html parsing and script fetching is done parallely and during execution time html parsing is halt

  ------------------           --------------------
        fetching     execution 

-> order of execution is not maintain by async

-> It is used to load independent scripts like counters or ads

-> which loads first run first 

3. defer

-> html parsing and script fetching is done parallely but execution is done once parsing is completed

  ---------------------------------- 
            fetching                  execution


-> Used when relative order of execution is important
-> It is used to load dependent script
